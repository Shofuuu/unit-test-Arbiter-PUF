# 128-bit Arbiter PUF IP with Xilinx Zynq FPGA

This project implements an Intellectual Property (IP) for a 128-bit Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) using Xilinx Zynq FPGA technology. The PUF IP is designed to receive a Challenge Response Pair (CRP) and send the corresponding Response via UART communication. The PUF IP is written in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and is designed to wait for the CRP to be fully received, which is 128 bits, before processing it. This process is managed by a controller within the FPGA.

The PUF IP communicates with a unit test program on a computer that is written in the C programming language. The project description includes a thorough explanation of the design and functionality of the PUF IP, as well as the communication process between the PUF IP and the unit test program.

The use of Xilinx Zynq FPGA technology allows for efficient implementation of the PUF IP, providing high performance and low power consumption. The project demonstrates the successful integration of hardware and software components, highlighting the benefits of utilizing FPGA technology in embedded systems.

## Installation

This project requires Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and Xilinx SDK to be installed. The Verilog HDL code for the PUF IP is included in the `src/` directory, and the C code for the unit test program is included in the `test/` directory.

## Usage

To use the PUF IP, first program the FPGA with the bitstream generated by Vivado. Then, run the unit test program on a computer connected to the FPGA via UART. The unit test program sends CRPs to the PUF IP and receives Responses in return.
